# Roblox Group Management Discord Bot

## Overview

This is a Discord bot designed to manage Roblox group operations through Discord slash commands with an integrated web dashboard. The bot allows Discord users to verify their Roblox accounts and enables authorized users to rank other verified members within the Roblox group. The system uses a hierarchical permission structure where users can only rank members to positions below their own rank.

**NEW:** Web dashboard functionality has been added, allowing users to send custom messages to Discord servers through a React-based interface with PostgreSQL database integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js application using CommonJS modules
- **Framework**: Discord.js v14 for Discord API integration
- **Architecture Pattern**: Service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for persistent data
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls to Roblox services
- **24/7 Runtime**: Advanced process manager with keep-alive service and health monitoring

### Key Design Decisions
- **Memory-based storage**: Chosen for simplicity and quick prototyping, though data is lost on restart
- **Slash commands**: Modern Discord interaction pattern for better user experience
- **Service layer**: Separates business logic from command handlers for maintainability
- **Hierarchical permissions**: Mirrors typical Roblox group rank structures

## Key Components

### Command System
- **Location**: `/commands/` directory
- **Commands Available**:
  - `/verify <username>` - Links Discord account to Roblox account
  - `/rank <username> <rank>` - Ranks any user in the Roblox group by username
  - `/help` - Displays bot usage information
- **Handler**: Dynamic command loading and Discord API registration

### Services Layer
- **Verification Service**: Manages Discord-to-Roblox account linking
- **Ranking Service**: Handles user rank modifications with permission checks
- **Roblox Service**: Interfaces with Roblox APIs for user and group data

### Storage System
- **Memory Database**: Simple in-memory storage for verification data and ranking logs
- **Data Types**: User verifications, ranking history, and system logs
- **Limitations**: Data persists only during bot runtime

### Utilities
- **Logger**: Configurable logging system with multiple levels
- **Permissions**: Role-based access control for ranking operations
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management

## Data Flow

### Verification Process
1. User runs `/verify <username>` command
2. Bot fetches Roblox user data via username lookup
3. Bot verifies user is a member of the configured group
4. Bot stores verification mapping in memory database
5. User receives confirmation with current rank information

### Ranking Process
1. Authorized user runs `/rank <username> <rank>` command
2. Bot validates commander is verified and refreshes their rank
3. Bot looks up target user by username and checks group membership
4. Bot validates commander has higher rank than target user
5. Bot validates target rank exists in group and is below commander's rank
6. Bot updates user's rank via Roblox API
7. Bot logs the ranking action and updates verification data if user is verified

## External Dependencies

### Discord Integration
- **Discord.js**: Primary library for Discord bot functionality
- **Required Intents**: Guilds, Guild Messages, Message Content, Guild Members
- **API Version**: Discord API v10

### Roblox Integration
- **Roblox API**: User lookup and group management
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - User information by username
  - Group membership verification
  - Role assignment and management
- **Authentication**: Requires Roblox API key (not implemented in current code)

### Environment Variables
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Bot authentication token
- `ROBLOX_API_KEY`: Roblox API authentication
- `ROBLOX_GROUP_ID`: Target group for management
- `CLIENT_ID`: Discord application client ID
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity control

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Platform**: Designed for Replit deployment
- **Entry Point**: `index.js` file
- **Dependencies**: Managed via npm (package.json)
- **Configuration**: Environment variable based

### Deployment Requirements
- Node.js runtime environment
- Discord bot token and application setup
- Roblox API access and group management permissions
- Proper environment variable configuration

### Scaling Considerations
- Memory database limits scalability
- No persistent storage between restarts
- Single-instance deployment model
- API rate limiting not implemented
